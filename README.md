# Gasket

Gasket is a command-line tool for uncovering bridges between JavaScript and
low-level native code such as C, Rust, or WebAssembly.
It performs a dynamic analysis that systematically inspects
the in-memory layout of JavaScript function objects to identify
functions that cross the language boundary.

Detecting these cross-language links, Gasket enables
powerful cross-language analyses, including:

* Vulnerability detection in native bindings

* Cross-language call graph construction

* Supply-chain and dependency security auditing
